Machine Learning Projects ‚Äì Internship Tasks

üìå **Note**: This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** completed as part of my internship at TechNest Intern.

The repository includes end-to-end notebooks covering tasks such as sentiment classification, time series forecasting, clustering, decision trees, recommendation systems, and image classification ‚Äî each designed to apply core ML concepts on real-world datasets.

## üìÅ Project Overview

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis**

Classifies tweet sentiment (positive or negative) using **TF‚ÄëIDF vectorization** and a **Logistic Regression** model.
Includes preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

### 2. **Time Series Forecasting**

Forecasts stock prices using an **LSTM**-based deep learning model.
Covers EDA, scaling, sequence creation, model building, and forecasting accuracy evaluation.

### 3. **K‚ÄëMeans Clustering**

Applies the K‚ÄëMeans algorithm to cluster structured data points.
Uses the **elbow method** to find optimal clusters and visualize groupings.

### 4. **Decision Tree Classifier**

Builds a **classification tree** using Gini/Entropy criteria.
Trains on a structured dataset and visualizes decision paths to interpret logic.

### 5. **Recommendation System**

Implements **collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (SVD)**.
Generates personalized movie recommendations based on user-movie ratings.

### 6. **Image Classification**

Classifies chest X‚Äëray images into "Normal" and "Pneumonia" using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
Includes image loading, preprocessing, model training, and validation.
